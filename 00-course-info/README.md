Welcome to the part time Data Science course at General Assembly!

In our part-time course, we will use Python (currently v2.7) to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. 

Specifically, you will learn to:

- Define the language and approaches used by data scientists to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, including the command line, python, and pandas.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

## Project Structure

This course provides two types of projects: **unit** projects and a **final** project.

#### Unit Projects
Our data science course contains **three** unit projects, to be completed at the end of each unit. These enrichment projects ask you to synthesize the skills learned in that unit. You will be required to complete projects for Units 1 and 2. 

> Note: Our Unit 3 project is optional, but strongly encouraged!

#### Final Project

The final project asks you to apply your skills to a real world problem. This final project is broken down into five smaller deliverables, which helps you to perform each step of our data science workflow while tackling a real world projet.

### Project Breakdown

1. [Project 1: Python Technical Code Challenges][2-1A]
2. [Project 2: EDA + Chipotle][2-1B]
3. [Project 3: Linear Regression and KNN Practice (*Optional*)][2-1C]
4. [Project 4: Final Project][2-1D]
    - Part 1: Create Proposal
    - Part 2: Identify Dataset
    - Part 3: Perform EDA
    - Part 4: Model Data
    - Part 5: Present Findings
